About:

This one is a very interesting project ot introduct ourselves to signals in C, bitwise operations and PID values.
We must make 2 programs that communicate with each other 1 sending a mensage that the other displays in a reasonable quick time.

Usage:
Clone and make.
Then launch the server with "./server" and it will display it's PID.
Then in a diferent terminal use the client as the following "./client <PID> <Mensage>".
